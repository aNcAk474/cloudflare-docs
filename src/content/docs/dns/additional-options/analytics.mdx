When you use Cloudflare DNS, you can access data about DNS queries through a variety of sources.

---

## Analytics

DNS analytics allow you to evaluate data about DNS queries to your zone.

You can [use the dashboard](#view-on-the-dashboard) to get insights quickly based on the dimensions below, or [use the API](#explore-with-the-api) for access to all fields available in the GraphQL DNS analytics schemas.

### View on the dashboard

For a quick summary, view your DNS analytics on the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Analytics**.

The DNS analytics dashboard contains [four main panels](#dns-analytics-panels). The filters and time frame that you specify at the top of the page apply to all of them.

#### Available dimensions

- Query name
- Query type (same as Record type)
- Response code
- Data center
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Protocol
- IP version

#### DNS analytics panels

- **Query overview**: the number of queries per hour and their distribution over time. This information is segmented by each of the available dimensions and the graph displays the top five values. You can select the dimensions through the different tabs above the graph and quickly filter for or exclude a certain value from the results by hovering over it and selecting **Filter** or **Exclude**.

- **Query statistics**: an overview of query metrics based on your filters and selected time frame. Namely, **Total queries**, **Average queries per second**, and **Average processing time**. The average processing time is displayed in milliseconds and includes upstream queries in the case of [flattened CNAME records](/dns/cname-flattening/).

- **DNS queries by data center**:

- **Queries by source**:


### Explore with the API

For more detailed metrics, use the [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/). Refer to the GraphQL Analytics API documentation for guidance on how to [get started](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/).

The DNS analytics has two [schemas](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/querying-basics/):

* `dnsAnalyticsAdaptive`: Retrieve information about individual DNS queries.
* `dnsAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`: Get reports on aggregate information only.

You can configure a maximum time frame over which analytics can be queried of up to 31 days.

## Logs

Logs let Enterprise customers view [detailed information](/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/dns_logs/) about individual DNS queries.

For help setting up Logpush, refer to [Get started with Logs](/logs/get-started/).
