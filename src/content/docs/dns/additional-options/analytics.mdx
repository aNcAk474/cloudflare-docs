When you use Cloudflare DNS, you can access data about DNS queries through a variety of sources.

## Analytics

DNS analytics allow you to evaluate data about DNS queries to your zone.

:::caution[Warning]
The [DNS analytics API](/api/operations/dns-analytics-table), along with the available [API properties](/dns/reference/analytics-api-properties/), will be deprecated soon. Refer to the sections below for information on how to use the new DNS analytics based on GraphQL.
:::

### View on the dashboard

For a quick summary, view your DNS analytics on the dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Analytics**.

### Explore with the API

For more detailed metrics, use the [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/). Refer to the GraphQL Analytics API documentation for guidance on how to [get started](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/).

The DNS analytics has two [schemas](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/querying-basics/):

* `dnsAnalyticsAdaptive`: Retrieve information about individual DNS queries.
* `dnsAnalyticsAdaptiveGroups`: Get reports on aggregate information only.

You can configure a maximum time frame over which analytics can be queried of up to 31 days.

## Logs

Logs let Enterprise customers view [detailed information](/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/dns_logs/) about individual DNS queries.

For help setting up Logpush, refer to [Get started with Logs](/logs/get-started/).
